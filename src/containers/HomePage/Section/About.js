                            What do you know about the coronavirus disease
                            (COVID-19) that is causing a health emergency?
                            Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses
                            that cause illness ranging from the common cold to
                            more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory
                            Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory
                            Syndrome (SARS-CoV). COVID-19 is caused by a
                            coronavirus that has not been previously identified
                            in humans (SARS-CoV-2). To find out more, watch this
